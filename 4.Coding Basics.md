### Struct/Structures, They are user defined data typed in used to group a number of data types into a single unit. It makes the data stored inside easy to access and manipulate. Each item is called its "member" or "element", the use of these in WindowsAPI is that they require a populated structure or they will take a structure and populate it. Here is an example of ``THREADENTRY32``

```
typedef struct tagTHREADENTRY32 {
  DWORD dwSize; // Member 1
  DWORD cntUsage; // Member 2
  DWORD th32ThreadID;
  DWORD th32OwnerProcessID;
  LONG  tpBasePri;
  LONG  tpDeltaPri;
  DWORD dwFlags;
} THREADENTRY32;
```

### Structs are declare by the `typedef struct` keyword, for example 
```
typedef struct _STRUCTURE_NAME {

  // structure elements

} STRUCTURE_NAME, *PSTRUCTURE_NAME;
```

### here after initiating a structure, the STRUCTURE_NAME would be the name of the structure and the \*PSTRUCTURE_NAME would be the pointer to that structure
