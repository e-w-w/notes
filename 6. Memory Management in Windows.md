The operating system has full control over physical memory addresses. In order to allocate memory addresses for apps, the operating system creates virtual memory. Virtual memory is distinctly different from physical memory, addresses in virtual space do not translate 1 to 1 to addresses in physical space. 

Virtual memory relies on paging and the operating systems pager, each page is 4 kilobytes long. 
## Pages have three states: Free, Reserved and Committed. 
- Free: the page is neither committed or reserved. The page is in control of the operating system and is not accessible by a process. Accessing a freed page will cause an access violation. A freed page is a page "waiting" to be used or reserved for use. 
- Reserved: the page has been reserved for future use by the operating system. Once a page is reserved, the address space it occupies cannot be used by other processes. It is also not directly accessible, you can think of this as a "promise" made by the operating system to give a process some memory in the future.
- Committed: the page has been committed and is in current use. The page is now accessible and is protected by one of the page constants (see bellow). The system loads the page into physical memory (?) once, during the first attempt to read or write to it. Once a process that owns the page, or parts of it, exits, the operating system releases the committed memory. 

âš  The page constants are: PAGE_NOACCESS, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, PAGE_READONLY

Here are a few ways you can allocate memory:
```c++
PVOID some_memory = HeapAlloc(
							 // Get the process's heap for the location
							 GetProcessHeap()
							 // Flags (0 = no/default flags?) 
							 0,
							 // How many bytes allocated
							 100
							 );
							 
// To write this to memory memcpy is needed
char* example_string = "Example String"; 

// memcpy copies the example variable into memory
memcpy(
	// Location to copy to
	some_memory, 
	// Variable to copy
	example_string, 
	// Becuase the variable is a string of characters byte wide, strlen returns the number of bytes the string is made of. Note that if the string is made up of wide characters some math may be needed to memcpy correctly
	strlen(example_string)
	);

// Remember to free memory once it is no longer needed
HeapFree(
	// General location of allocated memory
	GetProcessHeap(), 
	// Flags
	0, 
	// Location in the process's memory that we are freeing
	some_memory
	);

```
