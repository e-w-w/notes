## What is malware?
#### Software designed to perform malicious actions, used for both ethical and unethical use cases.

## Malware development life-cycle
#### 1. Development - Begin the development or refinement of functionality within the malware.

#### 2. Testing - Perform tests to uncover hidden bugs within the so-far developed code.

#### 3. Offline AV/EDR Testing - Run the developed malware against as many security products as possible. It's important that the testing is conducted offline to ensure no samples are sent to the security vendors. Using Microsoft Defender, this is achieved by disabling the automated sample submissions & cloud-delivered protection option.

#### 4. Online AV/EDR Testing - Run the developed malware against the security products with internet connectivity. Cloud engines are often key components in AVs/EDRs and therefore testing your malware against these components is crucial to gain more accurate results. Be cautious as this step may result in samples being sent to the security solution's cloud engine.

#### 5. IoC (Indicators of Compromise) Analysis - In this stage, you become the threat hunter or malware analyst. Analyze the malware and pull out IoCs that can potentially be used to detect or signature the malware.

#### 6. Return to step 1.
